Modeling Sleep Spindles

A Project for Statistical Machine Learning Course (YCBS 255-28)

Created by Ella Gabitov, March 2023

In this project, I use a data of a single participant collected by me and my coleagues as part of the neuroimaging study on the role of sleep in memory consolidation. The study protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Board of the RNQ (Regroupement Neuroimagerie Qu√©bec). All procedures were in accordance with the approved guidelines and regulations. Before participation, participants provided written informed consent and received financial compensation for their participation in the study.

The dataset and the code can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/EllaGab/YCBS255-28_project.git).

The goal of this project is two-fold:
1. To build a classifier to predict the coupling of spindles with the slow waves based on their characteristics such as frequency, amplitude, sleep stage, etc.
2. To explore a possibility to predict the source of the spindle (i.e., the EEG channel) based on spindles characteristics

Classification models and tools used in the project:
- Logistic regression
- Principle component analysis
- Decision trees
- Random forest
- Cross validation
- Parameter tuning and regularization

Programming language: Python
